# User Guide 
We are in the process of developing a user guide to help people use Boxer.

At present there are four pieces:

1. A [Get started tutorial]({{< relref "get_started.md" >}}) help you get familiar with the use of Boxer system
2. A [View descriptopn page]({{< relref "view_description.md" >}}) help you get familiar with each view in Boxer system
3. [Instructions]({{< relref "data_preparation.md" >}}) to prepare your own data for Boxer 
4. [Views manipulation]({{< relref "other_usage.md" >}}) to help you make views, save / load views configurations.  


The best way to learn how to use Boxer is probably to walk through the [get started tutorial]({{< relref "get_started.md" >}}) and read the guide in [views manipulation]({{< relref "other_usage.md" >}}). You can also learn the functions and detailed usage of each view in [view descriptopn]({{< relref "view_description.md" >}}) page. 

Once you're ready to try it yourself, look at the instructions on [data preparation]({{< relref "./data_preparation.md" >}}) that will help you format your data so that it can be read by Boxer.

For more complex use, you could go to [use cases]({{< relref "../use_cases" >}}) that showcase different Boxer features on example data sets. 

<!-- When you are using Boxer, use the "+" at the top left to select a data set. You place new views in the workspace using the "views" panel (on the top right of the screen, below filters). Use the left or right mouse button to select the items in a Box (bars of bar charts, or squares of a confusion matrix). -->
